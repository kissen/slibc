slibc
=====

This is a very much incomplete standard C/POSIX library for Linux amd64 systems.
I wrote it because it is fun and interesting to learn about core software. Maybe
it will be useful to you.

Highlights
----------

* Basic `printf`.

* Many system calls such as `open`, `read` and `close`.

* `mmap`-based `malloc`.

* Basic `FILE` I/O.

Requirements and Building
-------------------------

You will need somewhat recent versions of `gcc` and GNU `make`.

With those requirements installed, you can just run `make` and it should build
the static library (`bin/slibc.a`) as well as a bunch of test programs
(`bin/tests`).

Hacking
-------

If you feel like spending a delightful afternoon implementing some standard C
library functions, you can do that here. Please try to keep to the conventions
used throughout the code base. You will figure it out.

Before issuing your pull request, do run `clang-format` and make sure the
project builds without warnings or errors.
